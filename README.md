# Cookie-Stand Project

We were tasked with creating a website for Pat, who makes cookies in the shape of salmon (that also have salmon in them). 

This is a project for week 2 of Code Fellows 201. We were introduced to Objects and Constructor functions this week. The big JavaScript piece of this project was creating a table and a form, where inputing values to the form will add a new store location and data to the table. 

I used the Meyer Web CSS Reset.

I edited an image of Cookie Monster I found online here:

The other images were provided in the project assets and were required to include somewhere.
