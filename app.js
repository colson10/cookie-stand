// Create object literal for each location
// Create properties for min, max, average
// I also need a method for determining a random number of customers per hour
// Calculate and store the projected number of cookies purchased for each hour by multiplying the random number for that location times the average number of cookies per customer
// Store the results for each location in a separate array... perhaps as a property of the object representing that location
// Display the values of each array as unordered lists in the browser
// Calculate and display the sum of these hourly totals
